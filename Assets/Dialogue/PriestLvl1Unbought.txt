Oh, thank the Lord.
Honorary Knight, if I may be so bold to ask for your assistance.
There is a door ahead which is sealed by a magic spell. 
As a priest, I may be able to dispell it with the help of a spellbook.
I see that you have one bound to your waist.
However, that will not do as it has already chosen you as it's master.
You could let me make a copy of it with one of my spells.
Although I doubt the wizard who created the book would approve of that.
Alas, as I expected, an esteemed knight such as yourself would never do anything that would hurt the image of the kingdom.
There is another way. A merchant up ahead to the south is willing to sell the required spellbook for a single gold coin.
Coincidentally, there's a gold coin protected by an invisible maze up the stairs.
The runes guarding the coin allow only the smartest to pass, however.
